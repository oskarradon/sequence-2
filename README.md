#### Sequence Press Shopify Theme

##### Description:
A simple Shopify theme based off of the Skeleton theme.

##### Installation:

1. Install xcode from App Store
2. [Install homebrew & node](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac) tl;dr: ``` ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ``` and ``` brew install node ```
3. ``` npm install ```
4. create ``` .env ``` file using [this template](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/connect-to-your-store), and create a private app through the admin panel using those same instructions
5. These next instructions are for generating SSL certificates to fix a problem where styles weren't loading and my browser was throwing "Potential Security RISK!!!" warnings and are from [this issue](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/issues/726#issuecomment-425675011):
6. ``` brew install mkcert``` and ``` mkcert install ```
7.
```bash
  function ssl-check() {
    f=~/.localhost_ssl;
    ssl_crt=$f/server.crt
    ssl_key=$f/server.key
    b=$(tput bold)
    c=$(tput sgr0)

    local_ip=$(ipconfig getifaddr $(route get default | grep interface | awk '{print $2}'))
    # local_ip=999.999.999 # (uncomment for testing)

    domains=(
        "localhost"
        "$local_ip"
    )

    if [[ ! -f $ssl_crt ]]; then
        echo -e "\nðŸ›‘  ${b}Couldn't find a Slate SSL certificate:${c}"
        make_key=true
    elif [[ ! $(openssl x509 -noout -text -in $ssl_crt | grep $local_ip) ]]; then
        echo -e "\nðŸ›‘  ${b}Your IP Address has changed:${c}"
        make_key=true
    else
        echo -e "\nâœ…  ${b}Your IP address is still the same.${c}"
    fi

    if [[ $make_key == true ]]; then
        echo -e "Generating a new Slate SSL certificate...\n"
        count=$(( ${#domains[@]} - 1))
        mkcert ${domains[@]}

        # Create Slate's default certificate directory, if it doesn't exist
        test ! -d $f && mkdir $f

        # It appears mkcert bases its filenames off the number of domains passed after the first one.
        # This script predicts that filename, so it can copy it to Slate's default location.
        if [[ $count = 0 ]]; then
            mv ./localhost.pem $ssl_crt
            mv ./localhost-key.pem $ssl_key
        else
            mv ./localhost+$count.pem $ssl_crt
            mv ./localhost+$count-key.pem $ssl_key
        fi
    fi
}
```
then run ``` ssl-check ```
8. Run ``` npm start ``` to spin up an Express server with the development theme
