Step 1: Install NPM, Xcode, etc.

Step 2:  
 [Click here](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate) or run this in your terminal before running `npm start`:

```bash
function ssl-check() {
    f=~/.localhost_ssl;
    ssl_crt=$f/server.crt
    ssl_key=$f/server.key
    b=$(tput bold)
    c=$(tput sgr0)

    local_ip=$(ipconfig getifaddr $(route get default | grep interface | awk '{print $2}'))
    # local_ip=999.999.999 # (uncomment for testing)

    domains=(
        "localhost"
        "$local_ip"
    )

    if [[ ! -f $ssl_crt ]]; then
        echo -e "\nðŸ›‘  ${b}Couldn't find a Slate SSL certificate:${c}"
        make_key=true
    elif [[ ! $(openssl x509 -noout -text -in $ssl_crt | grep $local_ip) ]]; then
        echo -e "\nðŸ›‘  ${b}Your IP Address has changed:${c}"
        make_key=true
    else
        echo -e "\nâœ…  ${b}Your IP address is still the same.${c}"
    fi

    if [[ $make_key == true ]]; then
        echo -e "Generating a new Slate SSL certificate...\n"
        count=$(( ${#domains[@]} - 1))
        mkcert ${domains[@]}

        # Create Slate's default certificate directory, if it doesn't exist
        test ! -d $f && mkdir $f

        # It appears mkcert bases its filenames off the number of domains passed after the first one.
        # This script predicts that filename, so it can copy it to Slate's default location.
        if [[ $count = 0 ]]; then
            mv ./localhost.pem $ssl_crt
            mv ./localhost-key.pem $ssl_key
        else
            mv ./localhost+$count.pem $ssl_crt
            mv ./localhost+$count-key.pem $ssl_key
        fi
    fi
}
```


## TO DO:

- [x] xl screen sizes?
- [ ] use one events and postings blog and use tags to separate
- [ ] implement sass partials based on page type instead of having everything in one big stylesheet aka best practices :)
